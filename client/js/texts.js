            The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before the
            nations manhood can be conscripted. One month before the Government can conscript the
            young men of the nation -- it must conscript capital and industry and labor. Let the officers
            and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories and our
            munitions makers and our shipbuilders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all
            the other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators, be
            conscripted -- to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches get.

            Let the workers in these plants get the same wages -- all the workers, all presidents, all
            executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers -- yes, and all generals and all admirals
            and all officers and all politicians and all government office holders -- everyone in the nation
            be restricted to a total monthly income not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches!

            Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers in industry and
            all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage to their
            families and pay war risk insurance and buy Liberty Bonds.

            It was quite dark when the train pulled into Paddington Station in
            London. It was raining, too, and the wet asphalt streets became mirrors
            underfoot, reflecting the myriad lights of the city. There was great
            confusion at the depot. Luggage must be identified and collected;
            steamer friends parted with and cabs engaged.

            “My goodness!” exclaimed Miss Campbell, who had not been in London for
            twenty years, “I feel so lonesome all of a sudden in this crush. I do
            wish we had a man to help us.”

            The wish was no sooner uttered than it was granted by the kind and
            merciful providence who has a special tenderness for helpless,
            middle-aged spinsters.

            Along the crowded avenue we marched, the guards showing unusual cruelty
            toward us, as though we, too, had been implicated in the murder of
            their fellow.  The occasion was to serve as an object-lesson to all
            other slaves of the danger and futility of attempted escape, and the
            fatal consequences of taking the life of a superior being, and so I
            imagine that Sagoths felt amply justified in making the entire
            proceeding as uncomfortable and painful to us as possible.

            They jabbed us with their spears and struck at us with the hatchets at
            the least provocation, and at no provocation at all.  It was a most
            uncomfortable half-hour that we spent before we were finally herded
            through a low entrance into a huge building the center of which was
            given up to a good-sized arena.  Benches surrounded this open space
            upon three sides, and along the fourth were heaped huge bowlders which
            rose in receding tiers toward the roof.

            At first I couldn't make out the purpose of this mighty pile of rock,
            unless it were intended as a rough and picturesque background for the
            scenes which were enacted in the arena before it, but presently, after
            the wooden benches had been pretty well filled by slaves and Sagoths, I
            discovered the purpose of the bowlders, for then the Mahars began to
            file into the enclosure.

            Education still remains the privilege of a small minority, for it is idle to talk of education when the workman's child is forced, at the age of thirteen, to go down into the mine or to help his father on the farm. It is idle to talk of studying to the worker, who comes home in the evening wearied by excessive toil, and its brutalizing atmosphere. Society is thus bound to remain divided into two hostile camps, and in such conditions freedom is a vain word. The Radical begins by demanding a greater extension of political rights, but he soon sees that the breath of liberty leads to the uplifting of the proletariat, and then he turns round, changes his opinions, and reverts to repressive legislation and government by the sword.

            A vast array of courts, judges, executioners, policemen, and gaolers is needed to uphold these privileges; and this array gives rise in its turn to a whole system of espionage, of false witness, of spies, of threats and corruption.

            The system under which we live checks in its turn the growth of the social sentiment. We all know that without uprightness, without self-respect, without sympathy and mutual aid, human kind must perish, as perish the few races of animals living by rapine, or the slave-keeping ants. But such ideas are not to the taste of the ruling classes, and they have elaborated a whole system of pseudo-science to teach the contrary.

            I lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and
            follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I
            assure you. I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over
            there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth
            time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a
            conclusion.

            I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not
            arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or
            symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.

            It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.

            And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the
            spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot
            eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds
            of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights. In
            mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he received
            a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an
            agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his back and
            side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did not
            understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again
            on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came and he
            was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware that it was
            the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he charged, and
            as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.

            After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to
            rush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth
            and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.
            Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on
            the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the
            exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its
            ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the
            club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same
            time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle
            in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head
            and chest.
